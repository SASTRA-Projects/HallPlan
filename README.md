## **üìò Project Overview**

The **SASTRA Hall Plan Generation System** automates the creation of exam hall plans and seating arrangements at [SASTRA DEEMED TO BE UNIVERSITY](https://www.sastra.edu), building on top of [SASTRA Timetable Generation](https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/Timetable) project to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and ensure fairness.
This system replaces the manual process of hall allocation and seating chart creation with an intelligent, automated solution.

## **üöÄ Features**

* **Automated Seating Arrangement:** Dynamically generates optimized seating plans based on student enrollment and hall capacity.
* **Conflict-Free Allocation:** Implements rules to prevent students from the same class or department from being seated adjacently.
* **Customizable Rules Engine:** Supports various constraints like spacing requirements, block allocation for different departments, and varying room capacities.
* **Invigilator Assignment:** Module for assigning faculty invigilators to halls, ensuring proper supervision.
* **Exportable Reports:** Generates printable attendance sheets and seating charts for notice boards and invigilators in form of Excel sheets.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with a responsive front end for easy data entry and plan generation.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Backend:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) (Python)
* **Frontend:** [HTML](https://html.com/), [CSS](https://css3.com/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* **Visualization:** [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) for ER diagram

## **üéØ Project Vision & Mission**

At SASTRA DEEMED UNIVERSITY, our focus on academic integrity is paramount.
This project supports that mission by removing the administrative burden of manual hall plan creation, allowing staff to focus on conducting examinations smoothly.

Our goal is simple: **Let administrators focus on conducting fair exams ‚Äî not on drawing seating charts.**

The system is designed to prevent common issues that arise during manual planning, such as:

* Accidental seating of friends or classmates together.
* Inefficient use of examination hall space.
* Last-minute confusion regarding student allocation.
* Errors in attendance sheets.

## **‚öîÔ∏è Challenges in the Current Manual System**

Creating an examination hall plan manually is a high-stakes, pressure-filled task. It requires immense attention to detail and coordination, and even small mistakes can lead to significant problems on the day of the exam.

### **Problems Faced**

* **High Risk of Errors:** Manually assigning seats for thousands of students is prone to errors, where one mistake can cause widespread confusion and delays.
* **Time-Consuming and Repetitive:** The process must be repeated for each exam session, taking up valuable time and diverting staff from other tasks.
* **Inefficient Space Utilization:** Without an algorithmic approach, halls may be under or overcrowded, leading to wasted space or the need for additional rooms.
* **Integrity Concerns:** Manual seating plans struggle to enforce rules, like maintaining proper distance between students or separating those from the same course, raising the risk of academic dishonesty.

This project addresses these issues by introducing automation, consistency, and reliability to the examination process.

```
The [Timetable](https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/Timetable) repository contains the database logic, which [HallPlan](https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/HallPlan) extends for its specific purpose.

## **‚ö° Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>= 3.11)
* [MySQL Client](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) (Optional)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the Repository (with Submodules):
   Because this project includes the [Timetable](https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/Timetable) repository inside it, you must use a special clone command to download both at the same time.
```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/HallPlan/
   cd HallPlan
```
   **Note:** If you forgot to use --recurse-submodules, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` inside the [HallPlan](https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/HallPlan) directory to fix it.

2. If [Timetable](https://github.com/SASTRA-Projects/Timetable) logic needed to be modified:
   Go inside Timetable sub-folder using,
```sh
   cd Timetable
```
   or, see [Timetable/README.md](/Timetable/README.md)

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment:

- <details>
    <summary><strong>Linux/macOS</strong></summary>

    ```sh
